# This program has multiple usage and can do three things
# (1) Read an input particle distribution file and compute the mean
#     square distance between each particle and its nearest neighbourgs
# (2) Read an input particle distribution file and compute the SPH
#     density associated to each particle + the list of its nearest
#     neighbourgs
# (3) Read an input particle distribution and a neighbourgs file which
#     is an output of step 2), and output the tree of the structures in
#     structures.
#
# If steps (1) and (2) are probably correct, step (3) is still under
# test and construction. Step (1) was rather extensively tested, while
# step (2) needs further tests although I am quite confident it should
# be correct.

# PARAMETERS IN THE CONFIG FILE 
# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# 
# A example of config file is given in compute_neiKDtree.config
#
#
# H.verbose     : normal H.verbose mode (True or False)
# H.megaverbose : full H.verbose mode (True or False)
# filein      : name of the input particles/velocities file ('myfilename')
# Ntype       : format of the file (integer number)
#               0 : PM simple precision unformatted
#               1 : GADGET simple precision unformatted, cosmological simulation
#                   of dark matter only with periodic boundaries
#               2 : RAMSES unformatted (particles) simulation
#                   MPI multiple output
#               3 : CONE unformatted 
#               4 : Ninin treecode unformatted
# remove_degenerate : if this set to True, check for particles at the same 
#               position and add a random displacement at approximately 
#               floating representation accuracy in order to avoid infinite
#               number of KD tree cells creation. This parameter is global since
#               if a random displacement has been applied once for computing
#               SPH density, the same one must be applied again for subsequent 
#               calculations in order to be self-consistent.
#               Setting remove_degenerate=False will of course speep-up
#               the program at the cost of a risk of crash due to infinite
#               KD tree cell creation. This is however safe in most cases since
#               KD tree creation can now deal with particles at the same position.
#               It is therefore recommended to set remove_degenerate to False
#               first before trying True
# action      : 'distances' for computing mean square distance between each

#              (integer number).
#              H.nhop must smaller smaller or equal to nvoisnei. Typically H.nhop
#              should be of order 10-30 (template value 16).

#              H.nhop nearest neighbors for each particle ('myfileneighbors')
#              (this is a binary unformatted file which will be described more 
#              in detail in the near future)
#
# if (action='adaptahop') :
# -------------------------
#
# H.rho_threshold : density threshold. Particles with SPH density below this
#              density threshold are not selected. This thresholding will
#              define a number of connected regions, each of which corresponding
#              to a structure. For each of these structures, we aim to 
#              build a tree of substructures. Typically, one is interested
#              in finding the substructures of highly nonlinear objects. A value
#              often taken for H.rho_threshold is 80, which corresponds roughly
#              to friend-of-friend algorithm parameter b=2.
# H.nmembthresh: threshold on the number of particles that a structure or a
#              a substructure (above some density threshold rhot) must contain 
#              for being considered as significant.
#              The choice of H.nmembthresh is related to effects of N-body relaxation
#              (treecode) or over-softening of the forces (AMR or PM codes) or
#              SPH smoothing (SPH smoothing over a number N of particles tends
#              to ``erase'' structures with less than N particles).
#              Basically, due to either of these effects, structures or 
#              substructures with a number of particles smaller than H.nmembthresh
#              are not considered. A typical choice of H.nmembthresh is 64.
# fudgepsilon: This parameter can be seen as an Eulerian version of the thresholding
#              controlled by H.nmembthresh. It defines the size of the smallest structures
#              that can exist physically and is related to force softening.
#              Basically, if epsilon is the softening parameter, substructures with
#              typical radius smaller than epsilon are just coincidences and should
#              not be considered. The typical radius of a structure is given by the
#              mean square distance of particles belonging to it with respect to its
#              center of gravity. 
#              The criterion for selecting a structure is thus
#              
#              radius_{substructure} > epsilon,
#             
#              where epsilon=fudgepsilon*L/Npart^{1/3}. Fudgepsilon is thus expressed
#              in units of mean interparticle separation.
#              - For a treecode, fudgepsilon is typically of the order of 1/20;
#              - For a PM code, fudgepsilon is typically of the order of N_g/Npart^{1/3}
#              where N_g is the resolution of the grid used for the force calculations,
#              i.e. of the order of 1 or 0.5.
#              - For a quasi-Lagrangian code such as RAMSES, putting constrains from fudgespilon 
#              is not really useful. Basically it corresponds to N_g/Npart^{1/3} where N_g
#              would be the equivalent of the PM grid probed by the smallest AMR cells.              
# alpha      : a criterion can be applied to decide weither a substructure
#              is selected or not. Here the choice of alpha dictates by how
#              much the maximum local density in this substructure should be larger
#              than the local average density in this substructure:
#
#              rho_max_{substructure} >= alpha*< rho >_{substructure}.
#
#              Basically, the choice of alpha dictates the ``peakyness'' of a 
#              substructure. For instance, a substructure might contain itself
#              5 local maxima. For this substructure to be dynamically significant
#              we want the largest of the local maxima to be at least alpha
#              times the mean local density, i.e. the average density of all the
#              particles within the substructure. Dynamically bounded substructures
#              are expected to be very peaky. A typical choice of alpha would be
#              alpha=0 or a few unites, e.g. alpha=4.
# H.fudge      : a criterion can be applied to decide wither a substructure is 
#              statistically significant in terms of Poisson noise. Indeed,
#              even if Poisson noise is considerably reduced by SPH smoothing
#              it is still present to some extent, and some substructures might
#              be simply due to local Poisson fluctuations. 
#              Here the choice of H.fudge dictates by how many ``sigma's'' 
#              a structure must be compared to a random Poisson fluctuation.
#              The criterion applied is
#
#              < rho >_{substructure} > rhot*[1+H.fudge/np.sqrt(N)]
#
#              where N is the number of particles in the substructure and rhot
#              the density threshold corresponding to this substructure (in 
#              other worlds, rhot is the minimum density of particles whithin
#              the substructure). 
#              This criterion can be understood as follows : if a given substructure
#              contains N particles, the corresponding random poisson fluctuations are
#              of the order of np.sqrt(N). So typically the uncertainty on the density
#              estimate of a structure containing N particles is of the order of
#              np.sqrt(N) (this of course neglects the fact that SPH softening reduces
#              considerably the effects of poisson fluctuations). For the
#              fluctuation associated to the substructure to be significant, we
#              impose that (< rho >_{substructure} - rhot)/rhot > H.fudge*sigma with
#              sigma=1/np.sqrt(N)=np.sqrt(< (M-<M>)^2 >)/<M> where M is a Poisson process
#              of average N.
#              A typical value is H.fudge=4.
#
#              IMPORTANT NOTE : we should always have H.fudge > 0. Small values of
#              H.fudge will slow down the program, while large values of H.fudge will
#              make the hierarchical decomposition in terms of substructures less
#              accurate. 
#              The reason for that is that despite the fact we know all the saddle points
#              connecting all the substructures, it was impossible to figure out a simple
#              way of sorting these saddle points in order to construct automatically
#              the tree of structures and substructures. As a result, we operate 
#              iteratively by increasing the local threshold density as follows:
#              [rhot NEXT] = [rhot OLD]*[1+H.fudge/np.sqrt(N)] where N is the number of particles
#              in the substructure. Then we see weither saddle points within this
#              substructure are below the new value of rhot: if this happens, it
#              means that at the density level [rhot NEXT], the substructure is composed
#              of disconnected subsubstructures and the threshold value of connection
#              between these subsubstructures is approximated by [rhot NEXT] (the real value
#              should be between [rhot NEXT] and [rhot OLD]).
# filenode   : output file for the tree of structures and substructures. See below
#              for explanation of its format
# simu_unitsnei : True or .false : to specifie if the nodes positions and radii in the
#              file filenode are specified in the same units as in the simulation input
#              file or in Mpc
# filepartnodenei : ouput file for particule H.node_0 number. To each particle, a
#              integer is associated, which is the H.node_0 number the deepest possible in the tree
#              given in filenode. This way, at any level in the tree, it will be possible to
#              find recursively all the particles belonging to the tree. If the H.node_0 number 
#              is zero, it means the SPH density of particle is below the threshold H.rho_threshold 
#              and is therefore associated to no structure. 
# formattedpartnodenei : True for having filepartnodenei in ascii format, False for
#              having filepartnodenei in binary format. The format is in both
#              case, the number of particles H.npart in the first line, followed by id(:), 
#              where id(:) is an array of H.npart integers.
# fileneihop : input file with SPH density and list of nearest neighbors of each
#              particle, obtained by running comptu_neiKDtree with action='neighbors'.

# HISTORY
# +++++++
#
# 02/05/02/SC/IAP : first operational clean version with namelist and
#                   three options for the calculations.
#                   + action='distances' tested by comparison with the
#                   results of a different algorithm based on link list
#                   approach instead of KDtree (compute_neighbourgs2.f)
#                   The agreement between the 2 softwares is good within
#                   float calculation accuracy (5.10^{-6} relative 
#                   maximum differences). The differences can be 
#                   explained by a slightly different approach used
#                   in the 2 programs to do floating calculations.
#                   + action='neighbors' is not fully tested but should be
#                   okay. 
#                   + action='adaptahop' has been seen to work fine on
#                   a few data sets, but is not by any mean extensively
#                   tested. (No comments on the parameters of the namelist
#                   to avoid the users using this option)
#                   --> Version 0.0
# 04/05/02/SC/IAP : Full comments on the namelist parameters corresponding
#                   to action='adaptahop'. A few comments are added to
#                   the program. A new input particle file format is 
#                   added (RAMSES). 
#                   --> Version 0.1
# 04/17/02/SC&RT/IAP : Clean up the RAMSES format. Speed up the SPH 
#                   smoothing procedure
#                   --> Version 0.2
# 12/02/02/SC/IAP : Parallelize action='distances' and action='neighbors'
#                   Add RAMSES dark matter format with periodic boundaries
#                   (Ntype=-2), add CONE format (Ntype=3)
#                   --> Version 0.3
# 27/05/03/SC&RT/IAP&STR : Add RAMSES MPI dark matter + stars format with
#                   periodic boundaries (still under work, Ntype=-20) and
#                   a subroutine to remove degeneracy in particle positions
#                   Add GADGET multiple file MPI format.
# 04/06/03/SC/IAP : Dynamical selection of haloes and subhaloes :
#                   + new action='posttreat'
# 26/10/03/SC/IAP : add Ninin treecode format Ntype=4
# 16/10/06/SC/IAP : Change the treecode algorithm to be able to deal with
#                   2 or more particles at the same position. It is not
#                   yet completely safe in terms of the calculation of
#                   the SPH density (if all the particles are at the
#                   same position one gets 0/0).
#                   Add a few comments on file formats.
#                   --> Version 0.8
# 18/10/06/SC&RT/IAP : remove obsolete formats and improve RAMSES MPI
#                   format (now swapped from -20 to 2).
# 28/09/06/DT/CRAL: module compute_neiKDtree_mod.f90 compatibible with HaloMaker2.0
# 24/09/07/DT/CRAL: choice of 3 selection method using flag method
#                   HOP: Adaptahop is only used to detect haloes
#                   DPM: Subhaloes are selected through the density profile method, 
#                   accurate if studiing one step only
#                   MHM: Subhaloes are selected through the merger history method, 
#                   use this method if you need to obtain an accurate merger tree 
#                   containing subhaloes

    '''
    The subroutine 
    calculates the distances between the particle and cells (or the particles within cells),
    stores the closest cells/particles in `discell2_0` and `icid` arrays, and
    updates `dist2_0` and `iparnei` arrays with the closest particles.
    The subroutine recursively calls itself with the children cells of the current cell until it reaches the leaf cells that contain particles.
    The algorithm is an implementation of a tree structure, where cells are nodes and the particles are leaves.
